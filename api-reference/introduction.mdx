# CallHQ API Documentation

> Integrate and leverage CallHQ Voice AI through secure HTTP APIs to build real-time conversational voice agents in your applications and workflows.

CallHQ APIs are built with simplicity, consistency, and flexibility in mind. They use resource-oriented URLs, accept `application/json` request bodies, return responses in JSON format, and rely on standard HTTP status codes, verbs, and authentication methods.

<Note>
You must have a valid CallHQ account to access and use API keys.
</Note>

## Authentication & API Key Generation

To authenticate with the CallHQ API, follow these steps:

1. Log in to your dashboard at [https://web.callhq.ai](https://web.callhq.ai)
2. Navigate to the **API Keys** section from the left-hand sidebar under **Build**
3. Click the **Generate Key** button to create a new API key
4. Save your API key securely for future use

<Note>
The API key will be shown only once. Please store it securely, as it cannot be retrieved again once lost.
</Note>

### Important Notes About API Keys

- **API keys are hashed and cannot be retrieved once generated.** If you need a new key, use the regenerate option.
- **Note: Regenerating the API key will invalidate the previous one.**
- **Use this key to authenticate server-to-server communication.**
- **Keep it private and never expose it in public code.**

## Using the API Key

Include the API key in the `x-api-key` header of your HTTP requests.

### Header Format

```
x-api-key: <your_api_key>
```

## Example: Authenticated Request

Below is an example of how to make an authenticated GET request to retrieve all voice assistants associated with your account:

```
GET https://api.callhq.ai/assistants/all
Headers:
  x-api-key: <your_api_key>
```

This will return a list of assistants created under your organization, along with their metadata.

## Next Steps

You're now ready to start building. Explore the following sections to:

- Create your first voice assistant
- Manage call flows using Workflows
- Monitor usage and performance
- Integrate CallHQ with your own systems

Use the navigation pane or quickstart links below to proceed.
