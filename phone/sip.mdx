To deliver seamless inbound and outbound calling capabilities, CallHQ relies on **SIP trunking** and **virtual phone numbers**. These telephony building blocks are critical to enabling real-time communication between your AI agents and end users.

## What is SIP Trunking?

**SIP (Session Initiation Protocol) Trunking** is a method of delivering voice communication and multimedia sessions over the internet. It replaces traditional phone lines and allows you to make and receive calls via your internet connection.

### Why it matters for CallHQ

- **Reliable**: SIP provides a consistent and scalable method to route voice traffic.
- **Real-time**: Required for connecting your Voice AI agent with telecom infrastructure.
- **Flexible**: Allows you to manage multiple concurrent calls without physical lines.
- **Global reach**: Enables calling across geographies using virtual numbers.

CallHQ integrates with SIP providers to establish the bridge between your AI agent (hosted on our platform) and real phone networks worldwide.

## What is a Virtual Number?

A **virtual number** is a telephone number that isn't tied to a physical phone line. It exists in the cloud and can be routed to any endpoint, such as:

- An AI agent (e.g., your CallHQ assistant)
- A SIP address
- A VoIP endpoint
- A call forwarding destination

### Why you need one

- **For inbound calls**: Users dial the virtual number, which connects directly to your AI agent.
- **For outbound calls**: Your assistant uses this number as the **caller ID**.
- **For branding**: You can use a consistent business number across your assistant experiences.
- **For compliance**: Many regions require verified virtual numbers to initiate outbound calls.
