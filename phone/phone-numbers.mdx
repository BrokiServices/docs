CallHQ provides a set of pre-configured phone numbers that you can use to test outbound calls made by your AI assistant. These numbers allow you to simulate real-world calling behavior without setting up your own telephony infrastructure initially.

## Test Calls with CallHQ Numbers

By default, CallHQ assigns a managed number (e.g., `8071999799`) to all accounts for testing purposes.

### Limitations

- **Only Indian numbers are supported** for test calls at this time.
- **Calls can only be made to verified phone numbers**, especially for trial users.
- **Test calls are billable** and consume your allocated call minutes.

To verify a number:
- Visit your account settings and submit a number for verification
- Or contact CallHQ support for assistance

Once verified, you can place test calls to your own number via the "Get call from agent" feature in the assistant interface.

## Use Your Own Number

To make calls using your own business or virtual phone number:

- We support registering your numbers for both CLI (caller ID) and routing
