## Additional Configuration

### Background Sound

You can add background sound to create a more immersive voice experience, such as:

- Office ambiance
- Cafe noise
- Airport terminal

To use this, turn **Background Sound** on and provide a valid `.mp3` or `.wav` URL in the input field.

**Example:**
https://example.com/callhq-ambient.mp3
This sound will loop softly behind your assistant’s voice.

---

## Best Practices

- Choose a voice aligned with your brand and use case (formal, friendly, regional).
- Use background sound sparingly to avoid distraction.
- Use the play button to preview each voice before saving.

---

Once your voice settings are finalized, click **Save** and test the assistant via chat or web call.
