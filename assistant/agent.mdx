The **Agent** tab is the foundation of your AI assistant. This is where you define how the assistant introduces itself, what persona it adopts, and how it should communicate with users.

To access this section, go to:\
**Build → Assistant →  Agent → Add Assistant**

## First Message Mode

This setting controls how the assistant initiates the conversation. You can choose from three options:

- **Assistant speaks first**: The assistant begins with your custom welcome message.
- **Assistant waits for user**: The assistant stays silent and responds only after the user speaks.
- **Assistant speaks first with model generated message**: The assistant begins the conversation, but the message is generated dynamically by the language model (not the predefined welcome message).

Choose the mode based on your use case:

- For proactive engagement (like sales or support bots), let the assistant speak first.
- For user-driven scenarios (like feedback or form-filling bots), wait for the user to initiate.
- Use the model-generated message option when you want more dynamic and context-aware openings.

## Assistant Welcome Message

This is the first line your assistant will say if it’s set to speak first.\
Example:
Hi there. I am Riya from Travel Agency. Can you tell me the destination you are looking at?
This message should:

- Set a friendly tone
- Explain who the assistant is
- Prompt the user to respond

## Agent Prompt

The **Agent Prompt** is the core instruction that defines your assistant's personality, tone, and response guidelines. It includes three components:

### 1. Identity

Define the assistant's name, role, and organization.\
Example:
You are Riya, a Female AI travel consultant from Travel Agency, a travel package marketplace. Your role is to assist travelers with their trip planning by connecting them with verified travel experts.

### 2. Style

Describe how the assistant should speak.\
Example style rules:

- Use a professional, courteous, and friendly tone.
- Maintain clarity and warmth throughout the interaction.
- Speak mostly in English, using Hindi filler words only when needed.

### 3. Response Guidelines

Instruct the assistant on how to respond effectively.\
Example:

- Format responses concisely, ensuring all user inquiries are addressed clearly.
- Avoid overloading the user with information in one go.
- Ask clarifying questions if the user is unclear.

## Tips

- Keep the identity and style consistent with your brand voice.
- Adjust tone for specific industries (e.g., formal for finance, friendly for hospitality).
- Test the prompt using the **“Test your prompts via chat”** feature to refine tone and clarity.
