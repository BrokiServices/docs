## Create Assistant

After clicking **Create Assistant**, you will be prompted to:

- Enter an **Assistant Name** (you can change this later)
- Choose a starting point: either a **Blank Template** or one of six provided templates:

  - Customer Support Agent
  - Lead Qualification Expert
  - Appointment Scheduler
  - Info Collector
  - Care Coordinator
  - Feedback Gatherer

Each template includes preset prompts and guidance suited to specific use cases. Selecting a template helps you quickly configure an assistant for your needs, or you can start from scratch with the blank template.

##  What You'll Configure

When you create a new assistant, you’ll be guided through **4 key configuration sections**:

1. **Agent** – Define the assistant’s identity, tone, and welcome message.
2. **LLM** – Choose the language model (e.g., GPT-4, Gemini) and tailor its behavior.
3. **Transcriber** – Select how speech is converted to text (STT).
4. **Voice** – Customize how your assistant sounds using TTS voices.

Each of these steps is critical to crafting a natural and effective voice interaction experience.

##  Why These Four Sections?

| Section       | Purpose                                                                 |
|---------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Agent**     | Tells the assistant *who* it is, how to greet users, and how to respond. |
| **LLM**       | Controls how the assistant *thinks* and understands the conversation.    |
| **Transcriber** | Defines how voice input is converted to clean, accurate text.         |
| **Voice**     | Gives your assistant a *personality* through speech tone and style.      |

- **Welcome Message**: “Hi there! I’m Riya from Travel Agency. Can you tell me the destination you are looking at?”
- **Prompt Identity**: Female AI travel consultant helping with trip planning.
- **Style**: Friendly, courteous, uses English with some Hindi fillers.
- **Voice**: Indian English female voice from CallHQ’s voice library.
