Once your assistant is configured, it’s important to test how it behaves in real-time. CallHQ provides three flexible ways to experience and evaluate your assistant before going live.

To begin testing, navigate to:  
**Build → Assistant → Select Assistant → Right Panel**

## 1. Web Call

Use the **web call** option to simulate a real phone call directly in your browser. No phone number is required.

### How It Works

- Click **Start Web Call**  
- A voice call window will open inside your browser
- You’ll hear your assistant respond using your selected voice and LLM
- Speak into your microphone to interact

### Ideal For

- Testing audio quality
- Verifying transcriber behavior
- Previewing overall call flow

### Requirements

- A working microphone and speaker
- Chrome or Edge browser recommended

---

## 2. Chat Test

Test the assistant using text-based chat.

### How It Works

- Click **Test your prompts via chat**
- A chat window will appear for you to interact
- Your LLM and prompt settings will be used as-is
- No voice transcription or speech involved

### Ideal For

- Validating prompts and language model response quality
- Debugging assistant logic and style
- Reviewing how your prompt affects tone, structure, and relevance

## 3. Phone Call

Experience your assistant as an end-user would—through a live call to your phone.

### How It Works

- Click **Get call from agent**
- Enter your mobile number with country code
- The call will be placed from a **CallHQ-managed number** (e.g., `8071999799`)
- Your assistant will begin speaking as configured

### Trial Account Note

- Trial users can only place calls to **verified phone numbers**
- To verify a number, use account settings or request verification via support

### Billing

- All test calls are **billable**
- Minutes consumed during test calls count toward your usage quota
- Additional minutes beyond plan limits are charged at standard rates

## Tips for Better Testing

- Try all three methods to ensure consistent assistant performance
- Use chat for prompt refinement, web call for voice flow, and phone call for final validation
- Shorten your welcome message and prompt for faster debugging cycles
- Use different environments (quiet room vs. noisy space) to test STT performance

By thoroughly testing in all three modes, you can confidently deploy your assistant with optimal performance and user experience.
