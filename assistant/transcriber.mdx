The **Transcriber** tab determines how your assistant converts spoken audio into text using a Speech-to-Text (STT) engine.

To access this section:  
**Build → Assistant → Select Assistant → Transcriber**

## Why Transcription Matters

A fast, accurate transcriber ensures your assistant can understand callers clearly. The transcription engine directly affects recognition quality, especially across different languages, accents, and audio conditions.

---

## Supported Providers

CallHQ supports the following transcription providers:

- **Deepgram**
- *(More coming soon)*

Each provider offers its own balance of speed, accuracy, and pricing. You can select the one that best fits your use case and region.

---

## Configuration Options

Depending on the provider you choose, you may be able to configure:

### Language / Accent
Choose the primary language of your callers (e.g., English, Hindi, Hinglish). Some providers also support accent-specific models.

### Punctuation
Enable smart punctuation to improve readability (adds commas, periods, etc.).

### Profanity Filtering
Automatically mask or filter offensive language, if enabled by the provider.

### Confidence Threshold
Set a minimum confidence score for transcribed segments to be considered valid.

---
## Background Denoising

You can optionally enable **Background Denoising**, which filters out ambient noise (such as traffic, fans, or chatter) during transcription.

When toggled on:
- The transcriber applies noise suppression
- This results in cleaner, more accurate transcriptions, especially in noisy environments

---

## Best Practices

- Choose a provider optimized for your target language and audio environment.
- Enable punctuation for assistants that return transcribed messages via chat or CRM.
- Use confidence thresholds to reduce misinterpretation in noisy environments.
