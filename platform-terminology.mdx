# Platform Concepts

> An overview of the key components that make up CallHQ Voice AI agents and the tasks these agents are capable of handling.

## Voice AI Agent Architecture

CallHQ allows you to create intelligent voice agents that can interact in real time and perform useful post-call actions. A CallHQ agent follows a modular pipeline:

### 1. Input Medium

The input method determines how the user interacts with the agent:

- **Voice**: Via phone call or embedded web widget (microphone input)
- **Text**: (Coming soon) Typed input via web chat
- **Visual**: (Coming soon) Upload images or documents as part of the interaction

### 2. ASR (Automatic Speech Recognition)

Converts spoken input into text format. This transcription is sent to the LLM for further processing.

### 3. LLM (Large Language Model)

The LLM processes the transcribed text and generates a relevant response based on the agent's instructions, tone, and logic. This response is routed to the output processor.

### 4. Output Generator

Depending on the type of conversation:
- For voice: **TTS (Text-to-Speech)** converts LLM output into natural audio
- For visual or text output: responses may be rendered visually or as plain text (Coming soon)

### 5. Output Medium

Delivers the generated output to the user:
- **Voice**: Played back on a call or in-browser via the web widget
- **Text/Visual**: (Coming soon) Rendered as chat or rich content

## Tasks After Conversation

CallHQ agents can also be configured to perform additional tasks once the primary conversation ends:

### Post-Call Actions

- **Call Summarization**  
  Automatically summarize the entire conversation for review or CRM logging.

- **Information Extraction**  
  Extract structured fields such as customer name, reason for call, appointment time, etc.

- **Function Tools (APIs & Triggers)**  
  Use function tools to invoke APIs or external actionsâ€”e.g., booking a slot, sending a webhook, or updating a database.

<Tip>
These components work together seamlessly, but you can swap and configure models (e.g., use Deepgram for ASR or ElevenLabs for TTS) via your CallHQ dashboard or API.
